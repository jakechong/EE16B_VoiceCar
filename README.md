# EE16B_VoiceCar

A voice-activated car I made for my electrical engineering class using Energia, a breadboard, a car framework, 
an MSP microcontroller, motors, and wheel encoders. I don't have video of my car, but this video
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk3QCyXg5XI
shows how the car is supposed to run.
